## I felt in love - start learnint Product-Oriented
We will learn by mission 
Step 1.
We need create input that allow the use type in and when the user press enter we can get the vallue the user typed that is we do not want to do something with that value we just need getting the value.
One of core of Product-Oriented is the of unit of work that allow us to use exist html element to do some mission
we need to write our text box.
```html
<input type="text" logic="" onkeyup="this.output=this.value"/>
```
In PO every html  elements cat has output property. that will use to hold the value. in above code we just telling that when the user typed and release key the output property will be synchrunize with the textbox value.
the logic attribute does nothing but help us to fall intp PO selectors.
